# endless-driver
Endless runner type game intergrated with MongoDB Realm Unity SDK for backend.

## What is Mongo Realm and how it is used in this project?

Mongo Realm is an object oriented database system that persists objects in cross platform games. It can set or get native application objects (such as in Unity Environment C# objects). It also syncs data to cloud and Realm Instance.

It requries a Realm Object with a unique identifier (an object) within that realm data store. It is a player user id primary key in our case.
